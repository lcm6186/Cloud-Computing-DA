"====================\nTitle: Iron + Oxygen + Water = Rust. Where did Hydrogen go? Also how did 2 Iron come? [ See Pic] (https://www.reddit.com/r/chemhelp/comments/r6y6x9/iron_oxygen_water_rust_where_did_hydrogen_go_also/)\nTimestamp: 2021-12-02T03:59:15+00:00\n--------------------\nSummary:\nImage - https://imgur.com/a/1qElgmm  ​  I don't know anything about chemistry. I'm self learning chemistry.  I know that there is law of conservation of mass which means when chemical reaction happens, the mass is preserved from before the reaction, meaning \"mass before reaction = mass after reaction\"  ​  After Iron reactions with Oxygen in the presence of water, we get rust.  In the chemical reaction things always balance. like if there is two oxygen on left, there will be two oxygen in right  ​  In this case there is 1 Fe on left, but Fe2 on right. How?  Also there is Hydrogen on LHS but no Hydrogen on RHS. How??  ​  Kindly clear my basic understanding  ​  Thank You  /u/infiltratorshepard r/chemhelp [link] [comments]====================\nTitle: Hello from my spot in sunny NZ!
