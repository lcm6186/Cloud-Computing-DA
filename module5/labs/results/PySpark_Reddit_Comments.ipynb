    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is a framework for distributed computing; this framework aims to\n",
    "make it simpler to write programs that run in parallel across many nodes in a cluster\n",
    "of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is designed from the ground up for high performance in applications of \n",
    "iterative nature, where the same data is accessed multiple times. This performance is\n",
    "achieved primarily through caching datasets in memory, combined with low latency\n",
    "and overhead to launch parallel computation tasks. Together with other features\n",
    "such as fault tolerance, flexible distributed-memory data structures, and a powerful\n",
    "functional API, Spark has proved to be broadly useful for a wide range of large-scale\n",
    "data processing tasks, over and above machine learning and iterative analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Spark cluster is made up of two types of processes: a driver program and multiple\n",
    "executors. In the local mode, all these processes are run within the same JVM. In a\n",
    "cluster, these processes are usually run on separate nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components\n",
    "Spark applications run as independent sets of processes on a cluster, coordinated by the SparkContext\n",
    "object in your main program (called the driver program).\n",
    "Specifically, to run on a cluster, the SparkContext can connect to several types of cluster managers (either\n",
    "Sparkâ€™s own standalone cluster manager, Mesos or YARN), which allocate resources across applications.\n",
    "Once connected, Spark acquires executors on nodes in the cluster, which are processes that run\n",
    "computations and store data for your application. Next, it sends your application code (defined by JAR or\n",
    "Python files passed to SparkContext) to the executors. Finally, SparkContext sends tasks to the executors to\n",
    "run.\n",

    "JavaSparkContext in Java). \n",
    "`SparkContext` is initialized with an instance of a\n",
    "`SparkConf` object, which contains various Spark cluster-configuration settings (for\n",
    "example, the URL of the master node). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once initialized, we will use the various methods found in the `SparkContext` object\n",
    "to create and manipulate distributed datasets and shared variables. \n",

    "\n",
    "The core of Spark is a concept called the *Resilient Distributed Dataset* (RDD).\n",
    "An RDD is a collection of \"records\" (strictly speaking, objects of some type) that is\n",
    "distributed or partitioned across many nodes in a cluster (for the purposes of the\n",
    "Spark local mode, the single multithreaded process can be thought of in the same\n",

    "(for some reason other than erroneous user code, such as hardware failure, loss of\n",
    "communication, and so on), the RDD can be reconstructed automatically on the\n",
    "remaining nodes and the job will still complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating RDDs\n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs can be created from existing collections, for example, in a Scala Spark shell type as below:\n",

    "    val rddFromCollection = sc.parallelize(collection)\n",
